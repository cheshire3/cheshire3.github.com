                Indexes are the primary means of locating records in the system, and hence
                need to be well thought out and specified in advance.  They consist of one
                or more paths to tags in the record, and how to process the data once it has
                been located.

        <div class="fieldset">
            <span class="legend">Explanation</span>
            <p>
                Lines 1 and 2, 19 and 20 should be second nature by now.  Line 4 and the
                same in line 22 are a reference to the indexStore in which the index will be
                maintained.
            </p>
            <p>
                This brings us to the <i>source</i> section starting in line 6.
                It must contain one or more <i>xpath</i> elements.  These XPaths will be
                evaluated against the record to find a node, nodeSet or attribute value.
                This is the base data that will be indexed after some processing.  In the
                first case, we give the full path, but in the second only the final element.
                <del>Cheshire3, it is generally most efficient to give as small a path as possible to
                identify exactly which elements you want to index, so the path at line 25 is
                cheaper than the path at line 7.</del>
            </p>
            <p>
                If the records contain XML Namespaces, then there are two approaches
                available.  If the element names are unique between all the namespaces in
                the document, you can simply omit them.  For example /srw:record/dc:title
                could be written as just /record/title.  The alternative is to define the
                meanings of 'srw' and 'dc' on the xpath element in the normal xmlns fashion.
            </p>
            <p>
                After the XPath(s), we need to tell the system how to process the data that gets pulled out. 
                This happens in the <i>process</i> section, and is a list of objects to sequentially feed the data through. 
                The first object must be an extractor. 
                This may be followed by a Tokenizer and a TokenMerger. 
                These are used to split the extracted data into tokens of a praticular type, and then merge it into discreet index entries.
                If a Tokenizer is used, a TokenMerger must also be used. 
                Generally any further processing objects in the chain are normalizers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first index uses the SimpleExtractor to pull out the text as it appears exactly as a single term.
                This is followed by a SpaceNormalizer on line 10, to remove leading and trailing whitespace and normalize multiple adjacent whitespace characters (e.g. newlines folloed by tabs, spaces etc.) into single whitespaces
                The second index also uses the SimpleExtractor, however it then uses a RegexpFindOffsetTokenizer to identify word tokens, their positions and character offsets.
                It then uses the necessary OffsetProxTokenMerger to merge identical tokens into discreet index entries, maintaining the word positions and character offsets identified by the Tokenizer.
                Both indexes then send the extracted terms to a CaseNormalizer, which will reduce all characters to lowercase. 
                The second index then gives the lowercase terms to a PossessiveNormalizer to strip off 's and s' from the end, and then to EnglishStemNormalizer to apply linguistic stemming.
            </p>
            <p>
                After these processes have happened, the system will store the transformed
                terms in the indexStore referenced in the paths section.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, in the first example, we have a setting called 'sortStore'.  If
                this is given, then the system will create a map of record to term for the
                index to allow it to be quickly retrieved for the purposes of sorting.
