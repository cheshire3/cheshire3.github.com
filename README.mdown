Description
-----------

This is the HTML documentation for Cheshire3. This documentation is included 
in packaged releases and in the main Cheshire3 GitHub repository as a subtree, 
so you don't need to get it from here if you already got Cheshire3 by one of 
these methods. The documentation is maintained in its own repository, as it 
may occasionally be desirable to checkout/clone the docs in isolation from the 
software (e.g. for publication on our web-site.)

best efforts will be made to keep it up-to-date with the GitHub repository.
