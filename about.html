  			<span class="legend">What is Cheshire3?</span>
			<p>
				<strong>Cheshire3</strong> is a fast open source XML search 
				engine written in Python for extensability and using C 
				libraries for speed.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you're looking for an open source search software solution, 
				then <strong>Cheshire3</strong> could be just what you need!
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="fieldset" id="capabilities">
			<span class="legend">Capabilities</span>
			<p>
				Given a set of records, Cheshire3 can extract data into one 
				or more indexes after processing with configurable workflows 
				to add extra normalisation and processing.  Once the indexes 
				have been built, it supports such operations as ranked search, 
				faceted search, record retrieval, browse and on demand result 
				re-ordering or sort.
			</p>
			<p>
				A 'formats' plugin provides support for ingest of Document 
				types other than XML (e.g. Office documents, PDFs etc.)
				Plugins are also available to help carry out more advanced tasks:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Data mining</li>
				<li><abbr title="Natural Language Processing">NLP</abbr> and Corpus Linguistics</li>
				<li><abbr title="Resource Description Framework">RDF</abbr> based records</li>
				<li><abbr title="Structured Query Language">SQL</abbr> based 
				Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) Support</li>
				<li>Parallel processing</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		
		<div class="fieldset" id="features">
			<span class="legend">Features</span>
			<p>
				<strong>Cheshire3</strong> is feature rich, including support for 
				XML namespaces, unicode, a distributable object oriented model 
				and all the features expected of a digital library system. 
				It is Open Source, and standards are foremost, including 
				<abbr title="Search/Retrieve Webservice">SRW</abbr>, 
				<abbr title="Search/Retrieve via URL">SRU</abbr> and 
				<abbr title="Contextual Query Language">CQL</abbr>, 
				as well as Z39.50.
			</p>
		</div>
			
		<div class="fieldset" id="interfaces">
			<span class="legend">Interfaces</span>
			<p>
				<strong>Cheshire3</strong> is highly modular and configurable, 
				enabling very specific needs to be addressed with a minimum 
				of effort. The API is stable and fully documented, allowing 
				easy third party development of components, scripts and 
				interfaces.
			</p>
			<p>
				Using mod_python handlers, or WSGI scripts, any interface from 
				an online shop front, to Z39.50 to 
				<abbr title="Search/Retrieve via URL">SRU</abbr> to
				<abbr title="Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metedata Harvesting">OAI-PMH</abbr> 
				can be provided (all included by default in the 'web' 
				plugin.) The abstract protocolHandler allows integration 
				into any environment that will support execution of Python 
				code.
